# BubbleOKAN

The repository hosts the code for the implementation of the BubbleOKAN method for solving high-frequency bubble dynamics, which is built upon the Two-Step DeepOKAN framework which is also introduced through the current work. The code could be used for adapting it for a different problem or to reproduce the results showcased in our work - "BubbleOKAN: A physics-informed interpretable neural operator for high-frequency bubble dynamics".

The code will be released soon. Currently being tested before release.

## Two-Step DeepOKAN
#### - Instructions for Users

This section will be updated soon.

#### - Configuring Input Parameters
Adjust input parameters using the `inputs.yaml` file.
